# RECIPE-GENERATION-USING-FOOD-IMAGES
This project proposes a novel approach to automatically generate recipes from food images 
utilizing the powerful image recognition capabilities of the Google Inception v3 model. In recent 
years, with the proliferation of social media platforms and food-related applications, there has 
been a growing demand for automated systems capable of analyzing food images and providing 
detailed recipes. Leveraging the deep learning architecture of Google Inception v3, which has 
been pre-trained on a vast dataset including food images, our system extracts meaningful features 
from input images to accurately identify various food items. 

The key contribution of this project lies in its ability to seamlessly integrate image recognition 
technology with recipe generation, providing users with an efficient and user-friendly solution for 
obtaining recipes from food images. The utilization of Google Inception v3 ensures high accuracy 
in ingredient recognition, while the incorporation of natural language processing techniques 
enhances the quality of the generated recipes. Through experimental evaluations, we demonstrate 
the effectiveness and feasibility of our approach in generating accurate and diverse recipes from 
food images. This project has the potential to significantly simplify the process of discovering and 
preparing new dishes, thereby catering to the needs of food enthusiasts, amateur cooks, and 
culinary professionals alike.
